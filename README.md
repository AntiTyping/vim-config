# To Install
(Re)move ~/.vim and ~/.vimrc if you have them already, and run:

    git clone git://github.com/pivotalcommon/vim-config.git ~/.vim
    cd ~/.vim
    git submodule update --init
    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    vim +BundleInstall +qall

# tmux support (optional)

If you will be using VIM with tmux for remote pairing or window management, see
the README at
[https://github.com/pivotal/tmux-config](https://github.com/pivotal/tmux-config)

# Custom "command-t" matcher for CtrlP

We use a custom matcher for CtrlP that makes it act similarly to CommandT. Run
the following to install it.

    cd ~/.vim/bundle/matcher
    make && make install # or sudo make install if necessary

If you find yourself needing sudo, you might want to change the ownership of
your /usr/local directory to the current user (for single-user machines only):

    sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local

# Updating

First, fetch the latest vim-config via Git. You can also rebase or merge your
own project-specific customizations.

To install the necessary bundles:

    vim +BundleInstall +qall # or run :BundleInstall within Vim

To upgrade bundles to their latest version, use the bang version:

    vim +BundleInstall! +qall # or run :BundleInstall! within Vim

If you're upgrading from a previous version that uses Pathogen instead of
Vundle, you may need to do some one-time cleanup:

    cd ~/.vim
    rm -rf bundle
    git submodule sync
    git submodule update --init
    vim +BundleInstall +qall
